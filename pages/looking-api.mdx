# Looking Glass API

Are you a MSP, a programmer who likes data, or just a psychopath? Well then dive right into our Looking Glass API. This API provides all sorts of interesting data from any of our routers, in any of our POP's.

## Information Endpounts
All of our command endpoints require information to be provided such as site code. These can only be gotten from us directly, and below is how to do that (along with other things in the future)

### Routers 
**Response Format**
```ts
export type SiteArrrayType = {
    [key: string]: {
        name: string; 
        address:string, 
        hostname: string
    } 
}
```

Each router has a string key that identifies it, sites can have multiple routers and they can be queried individually to see differences inside of our network. Below is an example CURL command you can use to test the data returned.
```bash
curl 'https://lg.nixlabs.dev/api/routers'
```

If all went according to plan, your output should look something like this
```json
Example API Response

{
  "rtr-edge.hopky": {
    "name": "Hopkinsville, KY",
    "address": "74.113.97.1",
    "hostname": "rtr-edge.hopky.nixlabs.dev"
  },
  "rtr-edge.amsnl": {
    "name": "Amsterdam, NL",
    "address": "45.146.4.91",
    "hostname": "rtr-edge.amsnl.nixlabs.dev"
  }
}
```

Any of the root keys (site codes) can be put in place of the ``site`` query parameter in any request. This will query that specific router.

## Command Endpoints
All of our command endpoints are JSON based and fully HTTP compliant. They return a single type of response that is outlined below. They also respond with valid HTPT status codes depending on the error condition that can easially be checked.

**Response Format**
```ts
export type APIResponse = {
    output?: {  // Only exists if success=true. 
      command: string;          //The command that was executed 
      hostname: string;         //The hostname of the router it was executed on
      rawCommandOutput: string; // The raw output of the command
    };
    error?: string;     // Only exists if success=false. Contains a error string
    success: boolean;   // Returns true if successful, returns false if not.
    timestamp: string;  // The timestamp at which the execution completed.
}
```
This is the type that is used in all of our command endpoints routes for response checking. This can be parsed in your application. Please see the object above to get details on the output object

| Field Name | Type | Optional | Explination |
|------------|------|----------|-------------|
| error | string | true | The error string in the case of a failure. Only exists if ``success=false``|
| success | boolean | false | A boolean that is true if the command was successful, and false if it wasnt.
| timestamp | string | false | The timestamp of command execution|
| output | object | true | An object containing the return data. Only exists if ``success=true``| 


**HTTP Response Codes**
| Code    | Response | Simple Explination|
| -------- | ------- |-----|
| 433      | Unprocessable Entity   | One of the parameters passed to the route was missing, invalid, or an incorrect data-type.     |
| 500 | Internal Server Error     | The server encountered a backend issue while processing the request. This is typically an us issue, not a you issue. |
| 200    |  Success   | The command was successful, and output should be expected. |

### Traceroute
This route is able to perform a traceroute on any host on any of our routers to a specified IP Address or Hostname. Below is the request and response parameter definitions.
```ts
//Request parameters
type RequestData = {
  site: string; // Must be a valid site code. 
                // Site codes can be viewed at /api/sites endpoint.

  host: string; // This can be either a IP, IP+CIDR, or HOST.
}
```
here is an example CURL command that performs a tracetoure to 1.1.1.1 from Hopkinsville, KY
```bash
curl 'https://lg.nixlabs.dev/api/trace?host=1.1.1.1&site=hopky'
```

Here is what that response should look like to 1.1.1.1 from the ``hopky`` site code.
```json
Example API Response

  "output": {
    "command": "traceroute 1.1.1.1",
    "hostname": "rtr-edge.hopky.nixlabs.dev",
